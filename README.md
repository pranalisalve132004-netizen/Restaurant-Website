# Restaurant-Website
Spice Delight is a fully responsive multi-page restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website allows users to explore the menu, learn about the restaurant, and book a table through a contact form with validation.

This project demonstrates my frontend development skills including responsive design, DOM manipulation, and form validation.
